Overview
Cucumber is a BDD tool that bridges the gap between technical and non-technical team members by allowing tests to be written in plain English using Gherkin syntax.

This project demonstrates:

Writing readable and maintainable test cases.
Mapping feature files to step definitions.
Running automated tests in Java.
Features
Readable Test Scenarios: Write human-readable feature files in Gherkin.
Test Automation: Automate test execution with Java and tools like Selenium (if applicable).
Reusable Code: Organize code for scalability and reusability.
Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

Java 8 or higher
Maven or Gradle
IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any preferred IDE
Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/shruthi72/Cucumber.git  
cd Cucumber  
Install dependencies using Maven:

mvn clean install  
Open the project in your preferred IDE.

Usage
Running Tests
Add Gherkin feature files in the src/test/resources/features directory.
Implement step definitions in src/test/java.
Use Maven to execute tests:

mvn test  
Example
Gherkin Feature File (login.feature)
gherkin

Feature: Login functionality  

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials  
    Given I am on the login page  
    When I enter a valid username and password  
    Then I should see the dashboard  
Step Definition (LoginSteps.java)
java

@Given("^I am on the login page$")  
public void navigateToLoginPage() {  
    // Code to navigate to the login page  
}  

@When("^I enter a valid username and password$")  
public void enterCredentials() {  
    // Code to enter login credentials  
}  

@Then("^I should see the dashboard$")  
public void verifyDashboard() {  
    // Code to verify the dashboard  
}
